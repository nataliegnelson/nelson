The grant, supported by the newly-established [USDA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative's Food and Agriculture Cyberinformatics and Tools (FACT) initiative](https://nifa.usda.gov/program/fact), will focus on developing data-to-decision pipelines for agroecosystem management through high-performance computing and big data analytics. The FACT initiative seeks to catalyze activities that harness big data for synthesizing new knowledge, making predictive decisions, and fostering data-supported innovation in agriculture.
