Dr. Alice Alonso, Visiting Postdoctoral Scholar in the Biosystems Analytics Lab, wins **First Place** in the Faculty & Staff category of the NC State Envisioning Research photography competition for her submission *A Meeting of River & Sea*, shown above. Her submission was of a Landsat-8 satellite image of the Suwannee River Estuary in Florida. We are analyzing this image as part of our research on quantifying the estuary-scale effects of oyster reefs on freshwater detention.
