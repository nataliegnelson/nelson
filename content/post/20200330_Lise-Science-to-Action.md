As a 2020 USGS National Climate Adaptation Science Center [Science to Action Fellow](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/climate-adaptation-science-centers/science/science-action-fellowship?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects), Lise will spend time at the Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center in Massachusetts this fall to develop an interactive web-based decision-support tool as part of the last chapter of her dissertation, which focuses on estimating estuarine vulnerability to water quality change under potential future climate and land use scenarios. Many congratulations, Lise!
