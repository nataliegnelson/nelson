Lise Montefiore, Biosystems Analytics Lab PhD Student, wins **Second Place** in the Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources category of the NC State Graduate Student Research Symposium for her poster, *Coupling climate, land use, and sea level rise projections to identify threatened estuaries in North Carolina*. Writes Rebecca Nagy in her post, [BAE at Graduate Student Research Symposium](https://www.bae.ncsu.edu/news/2018/lise-montefiore-wins-at-graduate-student-research-symposium/): "The 13th annual symposium, held each March, includes poster presentations from more than 200 graduate students from NC State University. Posters are judged by faculty, and students receive recognition for top posters. The goals of the symposium are to showcase the outstanding quality and diversity of graduate-level research at NC State, in addition to providing students with the opportunity to practice and enhance their communication skills with those outside of their discipline."  

Congratulations, Lise!
