The grant, supported by the [North Carolina Sea Grant](https://ncseagrant.ncsu.edu/) Core Research Program, will focus on developing a new forecast and decision-support tool ("ShellCast") for the NC shellfish mariculture industry. In addition to creating ShellCast, the grant will support additional analysis on historical management and water quality dynamics in shellfish growing areas along the NC coast.
