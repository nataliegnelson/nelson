Dillon Weidner is pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Ecological Engineering at NCSU. He is currently interested in implementing natural solutions to improve water quality. His past experiences include constructing a Floating Treatment Wetland (FTW) to help his high school’s polluted drainage pond, and documenting and analyzing data to ensure its success. Currently, he is employed as an undergraduate research assistant for the sweetpotato research project in the Biosystems Analytics Lab, and he works closely with Mariella Carbajal Carrasco. Dillon is from Wake Forest, NC and likes to fish, hunt, bike, and play guitar in his free time.
