Julia received her undergraduate degree in Environmental Engineering from North Carolina State University. While in undergrad, she worked on several research projects tied to the University, these projects related to the effects of saltwater inundation on freshwater wetlands, drinking water quality of residential wells across North Carolina, and spatial mapping of water quality parameters and submerged aquatic vegetation in North Carolina’s estuary system.  

She is now pursuing her PhD in Environmental Engineering and is co-advised by Angela Harris in the Department of Civil, Construction, & Environmental Engineering.  

Julia’s current research is focused on improving methods of measuring fecal bacteria in bodies of water through the development of machine-learning models to be used in combination with a multi-parameter sonde.  

Julia also loves traveling, being outdoors, and identifying different flora and fauna.
