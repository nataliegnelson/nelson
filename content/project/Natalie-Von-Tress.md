Natalie received her undergraduate degree in biological engineering from the University of Arkansas, where she researched the viability of harmful algal bloom mitigation using nanoparticle treatment. She has had internships at Garver in environmental consulting and at the Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information. Natalie is from Texas and enjoys reading and exploring new places in her free time. For her MS thesis, Natalie is analyzing connections between human-managed freshwater releases and harmful algal blooms in a large interconnected lake-canal system.
