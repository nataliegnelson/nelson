Sheila received her BS from SUNY-Binghamton in Biological Engineering, and her MS and PhD from Cornell University in Biological and Environmental Engineering. Her current research uses data analytics (i.e., data wrangling, statistical and physically-based modeling, and data visualizing) to predict and minimize human impacts on water resources at regional and and national scales. She's broadly interested in research questions exploring the relationships between humans, climate, and water resources (water quantity and water quality).
