## About

Research in the Biosystems Analytics Lab takes a data-intensive, management-focused, and interdisciplinary approach to the study of complex biological system dynamics. Members of the lab study questions related to estuarine and coastal water quality, land-sea connectivity, and the influence of climate and land use change on agroecosystem productivity in the Atlantic-Gulf Coastal Plains through the use of statistical, process-based, and machine learning models. As a team, we analyze a wide range of data types - from *in situ* monitoring observations to satellite imagery - and advance the use of predictive models in natural resources management.
