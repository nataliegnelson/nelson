## Principal Investigator

Natalie Nelson is an Assistant Professor of Data Analytics and Integrated Modeling in the Biological & Agricultural Engineering Department at North Carolina State University. She leads the Biosystems Analytics Lab, studies from which take a data-intensive, management-focused, and interdisciplinary approach to the study of complex biological system dynamics. Biological systems studied in the lab range from agricultural to aquatic, though most investigations focus on estuarine resources.
